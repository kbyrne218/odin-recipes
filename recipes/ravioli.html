    <h2>Beefy Baked Ravioli</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a hit with my husband and everyone else I've given the recipe to. It's very easy and satisfies that Italian craving.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>25 ounce package frozen cheese ravioli</li>
        <li>14 ounce jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 can diced tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    

    </ul>

    <br>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F</li>
        <li>Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until no longer pink. Drain grease, then stir in the spaghetti sauce and tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the sauce in the bottom of an 11x7 inch baking dish. Arrange 1/2 of the ravioli over the sauce. Sprinkle 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese and 1/2 of the Monterey Jack cheese over the ravioli. Repeat layers, ending with the last of the sauce on top. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top before serving.</li>
